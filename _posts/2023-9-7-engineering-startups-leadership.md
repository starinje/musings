title: A Few Thoughts on Engineering, Startups, and Leadership
---

Just a handful of takeaways that I jotted down recently after a bit of reflection on 12 years of engineering both as an individual contributor as well as an engineering manager.

### What do team members want most of all?
In a word - **Clarity**. People want to understand what is expected of them and how to measure success both individually and as a group. As an engineering leader, it is my job to cut through the chaos that is a part of any organization but particularly present in a startup, and provide clarity on what is currently the goal of 1) the team and 2) the individual contributor. 

Engineers are often asked to solve insufficiently defined problems. It is my responsibility as an engineering leader to clarify what is being asked for so that individual contributors can focus on execution.

### Simple > Complex. 
Engineers are infamous for creating complex systems that solve simple problems. True engineering excellence is **building simple solutions that solve complex problems**. Always strive to simplify the solution. A simple implementation reduces cognitive overload on the team and empowers them to ship solutions quickly. Once you have the essential functionality covered and operational, then you can layer on additional bells and whistles. 

### Encourage a culture of writing.
Writing has the amazing ability to clarify thoughts. It is not just the capturing of thoughts, rather it facilitates the actual development of the idea itself. As we write, we are forced to answer the unknowns of a given idea or strategy and it forces us to go find those answers. In a team context, it also serves as a catalyst for alignment by creating a source of truth for all parties to find consensus. 

#### What does this mean practically?
* Simple + Comprehensive code documentation. Any developer coming to the project should at a minimum be able to install and run the application locally and understand how to contribute to the codebase simply by reading the code documentation.
* Simple system level diagrams + documentation that answers:
  * What are all the pieces of the system?
  * What is each part responsible for?
  * How do all of the pieces fit together?
* Document problems and solutions in plain English in a single spot that everyone is able to find. Ultimately the engineering output needs to deliver a solution to a business or user pain point, and the language surrounding the requirements should reflect this.

### Default to Action
Don't analyze a problem to death. We learn as we move, so define the problem, identify a solution, and start building. It will evolve and change but you need to start the feedback loop as quickly as possible. 

### The Three Levers
There are three things that are always asked of engineering 
1) All the functionality
2) As fast as possible
3) Of the highest quality.

The reality is that you have to choose just 2 of these options when delivering a solution. You have to weigh which lever you are going to compromise. Most of the time, you should reduce the scope of the requirements to the minimum required functionality that still solves the problem effectively.

### When it comes to people:

* Listen - people want to know that they are being heard and respected.
* Include people in the decision-making process, when they are brought along on the journey they will end up owning the decision and putting themselves behind it.
* Don't be afraid to make decisions that not everyone agrees with. Just because you invite feedback does not mean that everyone has to be 100% in agreement before action is taken. What is critical is that everyone understands what the final decision is and what is expected of them to contribute.
* Allow people to try and fail, it's the only way we learn.
* Verbalize appreciation to people, we all want to be recognized for our efforts.
* Bring solutions, not problems.
